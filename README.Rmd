# metameta: A Meta-analysis Re-analysis Package for R

## Description

The `metameta` package is a collection of functions for re-analysing
meta-analyses in R and when publishing new meta-analyses. Functions are
available to calculate the statistical power for each study in a
meta-analysis, based on data that is typically reported in
meta-analyses, and for creating a “Firepower” plot, which visualises the
median power of a meta-analysis assuming a range of true effect sizes.
