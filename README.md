# metameta: A Meta-meta-analysis Package for R

## Description

The `metameta` package is a collection of functions for
meta-meta-analyses in R, which is useful for re-analysing published
meta-analysis. Functions are available to calculate the statistical
power for each study in a meta-analysis, based on data that is typically
reported in meta-analyses, and for creating a “Firepower” plot, which
visualises the median power of a meta-analysis assuming a range of true
effect sizes.
